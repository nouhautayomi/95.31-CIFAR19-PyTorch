I am trying to improve the accuracy and convergence speed of cifar10.

Now,I use ResNet18 and Ranger(lookahead optimizer+RAdam).
And I implemented AMSgrad's method in RAdam.

If you use this code, you have to add a new file in your folder,"cifar10_resnet18.pt".




Lookahead and ResNet18 reference is (https://github.com/michaelrzhang/lookahead).
RAdam reference is (https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/RAdam).
Thanks.
